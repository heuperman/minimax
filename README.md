# Minimax Tic-Tac-Toe

A Tic-Tac-Toe game where you play against the computer.

## How to get started

You can [play it online](https://heuperman.github.io/minimax/).

Or clone this repo with `git clone https://github.com/heuperman/minimax.git`, then open `index.html` in your browser.

## How to play

When it's your turn, click or tap on one of the squares to make your move. Press the restart button to start a new game. After each game you and the computer will swap players so both of you will have a chance at going first.

## How it works

The computer opponent uses a basic [minimax algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-hh51ncgDI) to determine the move most likely to lead to victory.
